        <h2 id="What-is-mock-trial"><a href="#What-is-mock-trial" class="headerlink" title="What is mock trial?"></a>What is mock trial?</h2><p>Mock court refers to the process of simulating criminal, civil and administrative trials and arbitration through real case analysis, role division, legal document preparation, rehearsal and court session. In short, it is to simulate what may happen in real court.</p>
<h2 id="From-participant-to-organizer–my-thoughts"><a href="#From-participant-to-organizer–my-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="From participant to organizer–my thoughts"></a>From participant to organizer–my thoughts</h2><p>It is the first club that I joint after I entered my high school. Now I am in senior two, I have changed my role from the participator to the club’s major organizer. In the first year I accumulated plenty of experience and took part in several competitions of different levels, which was essential for developing my ability as well as responsibility to become a leader. During the two year, the club had more members and developed a lot. It is no exaggeration to say, the thriving of the club is just like a baby’s growth. I am really glad to witness it. Also, taking care of it is my responsibility. </p>
<h2 id="Various-competitions–my-experiences"><a href="#Various-competitions–my-experiences" class="headerlink" title="Various competitions–my experiences"></a>Various competitions–my experiences</h2><p>At first I learned following the students from my upperclassman. Although there was no  teachers to provide us with professional suggestions, the club is well organized and has strong atmosphere of learning. With the basic knowledge of the rule, in the first stage, we rehearsal the whole process to practice. Then, our team battle with Nanjing Foreign Language School. We learned from each other.</p>
<p>Then came NUMT winter tournament, the most formal and competitive competition. Our opponents are from other international schools in China, they are all very strong. It was hold in January 2020. Before the opening statement , we listened to the judge state the rules. For each tournament the requirements may be different. Like whether you are required to ask for permission when approaching the witnesses or judge. Then there was an opening statement for about five minutes which briefly introduce the case and co-council. The attorney made the story be partial to his team even deflect the truth to some degree. (comprehensive thinking is needed particularly just in case your rival will object and gain award marks as long as it’s accept by the judge). Attorney was not supposed to be emotional during the opening statement, which was extremely challenging to my conclusion ability. Then the DIRECT was proceed after getting the permission from the judge. I asked my witness in forms of leading questions to show the case in the aspect which is bias to my part. At the meantime, the co-council of attorney may IMPEACH if the witness lies or say something irrelevant. So it was a great challenge to the my logicality of thinking. </p>
<p>The closing statement was coming eventually. The closing statement is the only document that needed to be edited during the course. It was of the greatest importance and always done by the most capable person in the team, as it decided whether my team can turn things around or not. It was my honor to take on this heavy responsibility in that competition, I am always ready to do that.</p>
