        <p>In some countries, it is now possible for people to buy products made in other countries. To what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problems?</p>
<p>Under the background of imposing globalization, it becomes more easily for people to import products. It will benefit the economy and promote the relationships between countries. However, it sometimes plays a negative role in the domestic market as well.</p>
<p> We enjoying using the imported products which are more advanced. Productive tools can make our lives more convenient and efficient. Our time can be saved since twice as much can be accomplished with half the effort. What’s more, if we import from a country which is very specialized in producing special sort of things, the price will be much cheaper since the cost of production is less, so that we can invest our money on other projects and be benefited from that.</p>
<p>There will be more international communications between countries which maintain trade contacts with others. Leading to improving international status and influences. People abroad will be willing to buy goods produced in our country as a result. The quantity demand will be increased, providing a conductive circumstance to domestic industry.</p>
<p> While, too much import will affect the sales of domestic product. Infant industry in our country will struggle with financial setbacks since the declining quantity of demand, which is extremely harmful to domestic economy.  What’s more, People in the country won’t seek for innovation and over-reliance on other country, so that if some financial problems happen in the future, they won’t be able to overcome those problems by their own.</p>
<p> In conclusion, I believe that importing products has a beneficial effect on consumers although it may impact the domestic market in some extent.</p>

        <p>Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?</p>
<p>A large proportion of waste from household is not recycled. Some people consider that it’s necessary to enforce laws to deal with this problem. This is possibly a viable solution, but I do not agree that it is the only option.</p>
<p>If recycling waste is legally required, people will possibly do it; otherwise, they can be punished. Regulatory requirements serve as a deterrent as any punishment, either fine or a community order, can impact on one’s life. If they pay a fine for failing to sort rubbish, for example, they may less money for covering living expenses. In cases where they reoffend, they may even be required to clean streets or pick up litter in public. To avoid these consequences, they will choose to dispose of rubbish in the same way as instructed by the government.</p>
<p>Despite the potential outcome of the legal approach, it may not be necessary when the government has successfully educated the public to recycle as much waste as possible. People dump waste recklessly because they do not realize the environmental benefit of recycling and the appropriate ways to do it. If schools and communities disseminate knowledge about cycling, all citizens can form habits of reusing waste whenever possible from a young age. Some publicity campaigns for instance, provide information about what items can be recycled and what facilities collect these items. If people take recycling as a normal part of their lives, they would engage in this activity voluntarily in the absence of though laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, legal change may be required in some communities or countries where people do not feel the need to recycle, but it is unnecessary if people have been taught to develop this habit since childhood.</p>

        <p>SEX EDUCATION</p>
<p>A fascinating show. Far more than just sex education.</p>
<p>At 16, not yet an adult, but not just a child. In this somewhat confusing transition period, there is a lot of temptation and a hunger for the unknown. Sex education is not only about sex, but also about love, acceptance of self, friend ship, sense of responsibility and kindness to the outside world.</p>
<p>Although the theme is adolescence, it does not define the characters in this period of time as children who cannot make choices for themselves. Instead, it emphasizes how important “choices” are to the growth of a “person”. How important it is to learn how to protect yourself, how to please yourself, how to face your feelings. No one can stop a person who wants to be independent from himself, and no one can limit a brain that wants to think. The more we learn, the more we can see, the less we will regret the decisions we make. It is decision after decision that makes us who we are. “It’s all normal,” a phrase that has been used many times in the show has already told us that making wrong decisions or meeting problems are not that horrible. That is the key of our growth. What’s more, If we were all born differently, then our feelings about love and sex would be very different. So stop doubting yourself for being different from “someone else.” Respect yourself, find your own pace, and always make yourself happy for yourself. </p>
<p>I believe that this drama has changed many people’s altitude about sex. There should be enough openness and inclusiveness instead of evading when there is something related to this topic. It is really important for us, even the society to realize that there is nothing to be shame about sex.</p>

        <p>Blog<br>Li Joaquin is a famous makeup blogger in China. Recently ,he showed up several several times on the Top-Searching since he was exposure by some entertainment reporters that he smoked.<br>Some people think that it is unreasonable for such a famous person who is really influential to smoke. This may make the young to imitate since they are immature which means that it is especially easy for them to follow bad examples.<br>While to my opinion, there is nothing to complain about. It’s no strange for a adult male to smoke. Nobody else was been influenced since he didn’t smoke in public. He is not a idol or superstar, just someone who earn money by his own effort. Since he is very successful in his area and start up his own business. Many people may be jealous and feel unfair since they don’t have the ability to become entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The chance for everyone on the world to success is equal. The outward ease of them always cover the huge psychological pressure they are experiencing in heart, which is closely related to the pressure of public opinion. </p>

        <p>RECENRLY, I haven’t come up with something exciting to record… I’m going to review the  NUMT  winter tournament…(mock trial competition..)</p>
<p>This competition was hold in january 2020, so I may be a little bit oblivious about the process about it’s sophisticated rules. During the reviewing , holpfully I can help myself remember more about it. Also someone who read this blog may know something useful about mock trial.</p>
<p>Before the opeaning statment , we listen to the judge states the rules. For each tournament the requirement may be different. Like whether you are required to ask for permission when approaching the witnesses or judge.</p>
<p>Then there will be an opeaning statement for about five mins which briefly introduce the case and your co-council. Of ourse the attorney should make the story be partical to his team even deflect the truth to some degree. (comprehensive thinking is needed just in case your rival will object which will plus for them as long as it’s accept by the judge)</p>
<p> Attorney is not be supposed to be so emotional during the opeaning statment. Here will be extremely challenging to your conclusion ability </p>
<p>The DIRECT may procceed after geting the permission from the judge. You may ask you witness in forms of leading questions to show the case in the aspect which is bias to your part no matter plaintiff or defendant you belong to.And oppositely the CROSS the attorney will oppress the opposite witness as much as possible. Meantime , the co-council of attorney may IMPEACH if the witness lies or someting else. Vise versa the OBJECTION exists. Different toranment always accompanies with different types of OBJESTION such as relevance , lack of personal knowledge, speculation(lay witness) and so on . So it’s a great challenge to the attorney’s  logicality of thinking.</p>
<p>The closing statment is coming eventually. The closing statement is the only document that needed to be writen during the course which decied whether your team can turn the tables or not.</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>THAT’S ALL</p>
<p>THANKS</p>
