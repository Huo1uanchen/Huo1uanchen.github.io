        <h2 id="What-is-mock-trial"><a href="#What-is-mock-trial" class="headerlink" title="What is mock trial?"></a>What is mock trial?</h2><p>Mock court refers to the process of simulating criminal, civil and administrative trials and arbitration through real case analysis, role division, legal document preparation, rehearsal and court session. In short, it is to simulate what may happen in real court.</p>
<h2 id="From-participant-to-organizer–my-thoughts"><a href="#From-participant-to-organizer–my-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="From participant to organizer–my thoughts"></a>From participant to organizer–my thoughts</h2><p>It is the first club that I joint after I entered my high school. Now I am in senior two, I have changed my role from the participator to the club’s major organizer. In the first year I accumulated plenty of experience and took part in several competitions of different levels, which was essential for developing my ability as well as responsibility to become a leader. During the two year, the club had more members and developed a lot. It is no exaggeration to say, the thriving of the club is just like a baby’s growth. I am really glad to witness it. Also, taking care of it is my responsibility. </p>
<h2 id="Various-competitions–my-experiences"><a href="#Various-competitions–my-experiences" class="headerlink" title="Various competitions–my experiences"></a>Various competitions–my experiences</h2><p>At first I learned following the students from my upperclassman. Although there was no  teachers to provide us with professional suggestions, the club is well organized and has strong atmosphere of learning. With the basic knowledge of the rule, in the first stage, we rehearsal the whole process to practice. Then, our team battle with Nanjing Foreign Language School. We learned from each other.</p>
<p>Then came NUMT winter tournament, the most formal and competitive competition. Our opponents are from other international schools in China, they are all very strong. It was hold in January 2020. Before the opening statement , we listened to the judge state the rules. For each tournament the requirements may be different. Like whether you are required to ask for permission when approaching the witnesses or judge. Then there was an opening statement for about five minutes which briefly introduce the case and co-council. The attorney made the story be partial to his team even deflect the truth to some degree. (comprehensive thinking is needed particularly just in case your rival will object and gain award marks as long as it’s accept by the judge). Attorney was not supposed to be emotional during the opening statement, which was extremely challenging to my conclusion ability. Then the DIRECT was proceed after getting the permission from the judge. I asked my witness in forms of leading questions to show the case in the aspect which is bias to my part. At the meantime, the co-council of attorney may IMPEACH if the witness lies or say something irrelevant. So it was a great challenge to the my logicality of thinking. </p>
<p>The closing statement was coming eventually. The closing statement is the only document that needed to be edited during the course. It was of the greatest importance and always done by the most capable person in the team, as it decided whether my team can turn things around or not. It was my honor to take on this heavy responsibility in that competition, I am always ready to do that.</p>

        <p> In some countries, it is now possible for people to buy products made in other countries. To what extent do the benefits of this development outweigh the problems?</p>
<p>Under the background of imposing globalization, it becomes more easily for people to import products. It will benefit the economy and promote the relationships between countries. However, it sometimes plays a negative role in the domestic market as well.</p>
<p> We enjoying using the imported products which are more advanced. Productive tools can make our lives more convenient and efficient. Our time can be saved since twice as much can be accomplished with half the effort. What’s more, if we import from a country which is very specialized in producing special sort of things, the price will be much cheaper since the cost of production is less, so that we can invest our money on other projects and be benefited from that.</p>
<p>There will be more international communications between countries which maintain trade contacts with others. Leading to improving international status and influences. People abroad will be willing to buy goods produced in our country as a result. The quantity demand will be increased, providing a conductive circumstance to domestic industry.</p>
<p> While, too much import will affect the sales of domestic product. Infant industry in our country will struggle with financial setbacks since the declining quantity of demand, which is extremely harmful to domestic economy.  What’s more, People in the country won’t seek for innovation and over-reliance on other country, so that if some financial problems happen in the future, they won’t be able to overcome those problems by their own.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that importing products has a beneficial effect on consumers although it may impact the domestic market in some extent.  </p>

        <p>Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?</p>
<p>A large proportion of waste from household is not recycled. Some people consider that it’s necessary to enforce laws to deal with this problem. This is possibly a viable solution, but I do not agree that it is the only option.</p>
<p>If recycling waste is legally required, people will possibly do it; otherwise, they can be punished. Regulatory requirements serve as a deterrent as any punishment, either fine or a community order, can impact on one’s life. If they pay a fine for failing to sort rubbish, for example, they may less money for covering living expenses. In cases where they reoffend, they may even be required to clean streets or pick up litter in public. To avoid these consequences, they will choose to dispose of rubbish in the same way as instructed by the government.</p>
<p>Despite the potential outcome of the legal approach, it may not be necessary when the government has successfully educated the public to recycle as much waste as possible. People dump waste recklessly because they do not realize the environmental benefit of recycling and the appropriate ways to do it. If schools and communities disseminate knowledge about cycling, all citizens can form habits of reusing waste whenever possible from a young age. Some publicity campaigns for instance, provide information about what items can be recycled and what facilities collect these items. If people take recycling as a normal part of their lives, they would engage in this activity voluntarily in the absence of though laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, legal change may be required in some communities or countries where people do not feel the need to recycle, but it is unnecessary if people have been taught to develop this habit since childhood.</p>

        <p>SEX EDUCATION</p>
<p>A fascinating show. Far more than just sex education.</p>
<p>At 16, not yet an adult, but not just a child. In this somewhat confusing transition period, there is a lot of temptation and a hunger for the unknown. Sex education is not only about sex, but also about love, acceptance of self, friend ship, sense of responsibility and kindness to the outside world.</p>
<p>Although the theme is adolescence, it does not define the characters in this period of time as children who cannot make choices for themselves. Instead, it emphasizes how important “choices” are to the growth of a “person”. How important it is to learn how to protect yourself, how to please yourself, how to face your feelings. No one can stop a person who wants to be independent from himself, and no one can limit a brain that wants to think. The more we learn, the more we can see, the less we will regret the decisions we make. It is decision after decision that makes us who we are. “It’s all normal,” a phrase that has been used many times in the show has already told us that making wrong decisions or meeting problems are not that horrible. That is the key of our growth. What’s more, If we were all born differently, then our feelings about love and sex would be very different. So stop doubting yourself for being different from “someone else.” Respect yourself, find your own pace, and always make yourself happy for yourself. </p>
<p>I believe that this drama has changed many people’s altitude about sex. There should be enough openness and inclusiveness instead of evading when there is something related to this topic. It is really important for us, even the society to realize that there is nothing to be shame about sex.</p>
